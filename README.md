## Description
This project implements a data classification system using IBM Granite, a state-of-the-art AI foundation model designed for natural language understanding and data processing. The main objective is to classify text or structured data into predefined categories accurately and efficiently. By leveraging IBM Granite’s advanced capabilities, the project ensures high scalability, adaptability for multiple domains, and improved accuracy compared to traditional methods. It is suitable for applications such as sentiment analysis, topic categorization, and intent detection.

## 🧪 Key Features
- ✅ Integration with IBM Granite models
- ✅ Randomly generated datasets
- ✅ Visualization of results (optional)

## ▶️ How to Use
1. Click the button below to open the notebook in Google Colab:
   [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/adysaptr/Data-Classification-Using-IBMGranite/blob/main/Data_Classification.ipynb)
   
3. Run the notebook cells in sequence.
4. For best results, make sure you use a runtime with GPU acceleration.
5. Adjust the dataset or prompt if you want to adapt it for your own use case.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites
- Google account (for Google Colab)
- API access to the IBM Granite model
- Stable internet connection

## 📈 Dataset
The dataset used in this notebook is a randomly generated dataset created using existing code within Google Colab. This is done to ensure the data is more varied, allowing the model to be evaluated using more than just one dataset.
